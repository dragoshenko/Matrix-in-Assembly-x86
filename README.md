# Matrix Initialization and Display Program

This assembly language program initializes a matrix with user-defined dimensions and values, then displays the matrix to the console. It provides a basic framework for working with matrices in assembly language.

## Features

- **Matrix Initialization:** Users can input the dimensions of the matrix and the values for each element. The program then initializes the matrix with the provided values.

- **Matrix Display:** After initialization, the program displays the matrix to the console, allowing users to visualize the matrix contents.

## Usage

To use this program, clone the repository and assemble the code using an assembly language compiler. Run the compiled executable to initialize and display a matrix. Users can input the matrix dimensions and values through the command-line interface.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

1. Enter the number of rows and columns for the matrix.
2. Input the values for each element of the matrix.
3. The program will display the initialized matrix to the console.
